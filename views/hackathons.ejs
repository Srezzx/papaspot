                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                        the
                        industry's
                        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                        scrambled it
                        to
                        make
                        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                        typesetting,
                        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                        sheets
                        containing
                        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                        including
                        versions
                        of Lorem Ipsum.

                        Why do we use it?
                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                        when
                        looking at
                        its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                        letters,
                        as
                        opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
                        desktop
                        publishing
                        packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
                        'lorem
                        ipsum'
                        will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
                        years,
                        sometimes
                        by
                        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
